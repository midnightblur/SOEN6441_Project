<Coding Standard>
This document lists the standard methods of coding that is followed by
all of the developers in the team for the Risk game.

-----------------
File organization
-----------------
- Source code files should be organized into four different package folders
(controller, model, and view folders) according to the appropriate
functions in regards to the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern,
in addition to the util package folder which should contain miscellaneous
code that is designed to store various configurations.
- A source file structure should be in a way that the file should display the
package statements, then import statements, and then the class declarations.
- The class declaration of a source file should first list its variables, then
the constructors, then the getter and setter methods, and then any other methods
and functions related to that class.

Example:

package ProjectPractice;

import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Some overall info about this class
 */
public class Player {
    private static int counter;
    private int playerID;

    public Player() {
        ...
    }

    public void setPlayerID(int playerID) {
        this.playerID = playerID;
    }

    public int getPlayerID() {
        return this.playerID;
    }

    ...
}

-----------
Indentation
-----------
- All new lines wrapped inside the body of a class/function should be indented by
4 spaces or by a tab space (see example) with respect to its header or the first line.
- Lengthy line of code can be written in multiple continuous lines, but all lines
succeeding the first line should be indented with respect to the first line.
- In a file with multiple classes and or methods, an empty space should be present
between the end of one and the start of the other.
- Curly brackets must be used following if, while, for, switch statements.
- The brackets following the if, while, for, switch can be separated from the key words
and the succeeding curly brackets (see example).
- All comments should start with a single space from the comment symbol (// or *)
- Line or lines of code can be separated by an empty line in order to improve readability
for major sections of a long and complicated function (see example).

Example:

/**
 * some comment
 */
public class Player {
    private static int count;
    private int playerID;

    public Player(int id) {
        // some comment
        if (id < 5) {
            System.out.println("This line is divided in multiple" +
                    "lines because it is too long.");
            System.out.println("this is a short line.");
        } else if(id == 10) {
            System.out.println("This is an example of another line");
        } else {
            while (id == 100) {
                ++id;
            }

            System.out.println("Example of empty line spacing for better readability");
            return;
        }
    }

    public void setPlayerID(int playerID) {
        this.playerID = playerID;
    }

    public int getPlayerID() {
        return this.playerID;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    ...
}

/**
 * some comment for this class
 */
class Team {
    private String teamName;

    public Team() {
        ...
    }

    ...
}

--------
Comments
--------
- Comments should be used to provide code understandability of classes,
methods, and complex algorithms, etc.
- At the beginning of each public class and public methods, there should be
a brief comment to explain the purpose of that class or method in the project.
- The comments in the beginning of each class, and methods should be in
Javadoc format (/** ... */).
- The comments for specific lines of code within a block of a method or a
function should be in block comment (/* ... */) format for multi-line comments,
or in regular comment (// ...) format for single line comments.

Example:

package ProjectPractice;

import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * This is a comment describing the Player class which displays
 * a general idea of what this class is for and what it does.
 */
public class Player {
    private static int count;
    private int playerID;

    /**
     * This is a comment describing the Constructor
     * (or other methods and functions) with the list of parameters.
     *
     * @param id: this is a meaningful id description
     */
    public Player(int id) {
        /*
        This is a multi-line comment inside a class or a method
        about the following line(s).
         */
        if (id < 5) {
            System.out.println("This line is divided in multiple" +
                    "lines because it is too long.");
            System.out.println("this is a short line.");
        } else if (id == 10) {
            System.out.println("this is another line");
        } else {
            // This is a single line comment about the following line(s).
            while (id == 100) {
                System.out.println("This is an example for nested indentation");
            }
            return;
        }
    }

    ...
}

------------
Declarations
------------
- Semicolons should mark the end of code of that line. Succeeding line of code following a
semicolon should be written in a new line.
- Curly bracket used for wrapping blocks of code should be used in a way that the opening
bracket is present on the same line as the wrapper line, followed by the block of code written
starting on the next line after the opening bracket, and then the closing bracket that should be
on its own on a new line following the end of the block of code, unless there are more else if,
else, catch, while, etc statements that follow after it (see example).
- A single line for, if/else, while, switch statements cannot be written without curly brackets.
- All classes should start with an uppercase letter, followed by lowercase letters. For names
that consist of multiple words, the first letter of all the words after the first letter should
be capitalized (see example).
- All variable names should be in lowercase letters (and/or numbers). If a variable name consists
of multiple words, then the first letter of the words (except for the starting letter of the
variable name) should be in uppercase letter (see example).
- All final variables and enum variables should be in all capital letters.
- All variables, function declarations should indicate their access specifiers.

Example:

class Example {
    ...
}

public class MultiWordClassName {
    public int variable;
    private int variableWithMultipleWords;

    public MultiWordClassName() {
        if () {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                ...
            }
        } else () {
            ...
            ...
            ...
        }

        System.out.println("...");
    }

    public void exampleMethod() {
        ...
    }
}




------
Naming
------
- All class, method, variable names should be meaningful names, and single letter names should
be refrained from use, unless in the case of temporary variables used within a for loop (see Example).
- File names used in import statements should be in all lowercase letters.

Example:

import filename;

public int playerID;
public int exampleCounter;
private String playerFirstName;
private String playerLastName;

for (int i=0; i<exampleCounter; i++) {
    System.out.println("Player " + playerID);
}
